My current Database Design Project on UTD Activity Center
The first phase is gathering requirements from the staff members of the Activity Center.

The Second phase is to draw the Entity Relationship Diagram from these requirements.

Third phase involved mapping the ER Diagram into Relational Schema.

We found that one of the tables did not adhere to the Third Normal Form and we had to Normalise into the 3NF.

The final relational schema consists of all the relations, which are in 3NF.

After the schema is finalized, we have created the tables and data has been populated in the tables. We used Oracle 11g Instance for creating the tables.

We also have four PL/SQL Stored Procedures written.
